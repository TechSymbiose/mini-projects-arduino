# Distance meter

Project done by Adrien Louvrier, 29/12/2020
The goal is to print on the 7 segments displays the distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor

# Electronic circuit
input : 
- ultrasonic sensor (trig -> pin 12, echo -> pin 13, Vcc -> 5V, grd -> grd)
- 4*7 segments display (a to g -> 2 to 8, point -> 9, digit 3 -> 10, digit 4 -> 11)
