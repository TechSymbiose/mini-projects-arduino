# Water level sensor

Project done by Adrien Louvrier, 14/01/2021
The goal is to turn on leds according to the level of water

# Electronic circuit
input : 
	- water level sensor (S -> A0, Vcc -> 5V, grd -> grd)

output : 
	- red led with 330 Omhs resistance (Vcc -> 2, grd -> grd)
	- yellow led with 330 Omhs resistance (Vcc -> 3, grd -> grd)
	- green led with 330 Omhs resistance (Vcc -> 4, grd -> grd)
