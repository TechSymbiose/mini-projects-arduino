# 4 bits 7 segments display 

Mini-project done by Adrien Louvrier, 22/12/2020
The goal is to enter a 4 bits number (from 0 to 15) thanks to 4 buttons (one button per bit) and print this number on a 7 segments display

# Electronic circuit 

input :
	- 4 buttons connected to Vcc and pins 2 to 5
	- 4 resistances 10kOhms connected to grd and pins 2 to 5
output :
	- a 7 segments display (with resistances 330 Ohms on each segment input) connected to grd and pins 6 to 12
